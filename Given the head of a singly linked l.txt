Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.
 
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
 
5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
 
1 -> 2
2 -> 1
 
Example 1:
 
 
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
Example 2:
 
 
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
Example 3:
 
Input: head = []
Output: []



list[i] = list[n-i]%n
